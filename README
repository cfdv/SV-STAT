#terrible hard-coded paths and file formats:
hypoDBgen assumes genomic sequence data is on /home/cdavis/goldenpath/hg*/chromosomes/chr*.ol
- .ol format => where fasta header is stripped, and entire sequence is stored on the first line of the file.

#unfriendly, hard-coded SVSTAT parameters in hypoDBgen.pl
#algorithm parameters to limit the number of junctions considered
$significant_read_tail_length = 4;      #a junction is not considered if neither one has a read of this length or greater
$significant_stack_sum_tail_lengths = 8;        #a junction is not considered if the sum of the tail lengths in both stacks is this number or less
$significant_deletion_length = 2;       #forward and reverse stack coordinates have to be separated by a gap of this size or larger
$cj_per_page = 3000000; #3e6 candidate junctions per array, to stay within bwa's index size limit
